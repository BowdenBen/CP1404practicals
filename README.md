# Practical Exercises Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the exercise repository of Ben Bowden. Here you will find my CP1404 practicals.

## About Me
I am a complete moron at coding. Proof of this is found within these files.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned
- **Classes**: Creating code outside of the main structure to handle objects within that structure.
- **Modularization**: Breaking down code into smaller, manageable functions or modules enhances maintainability and reusability.
- **Consistent Indentation and Formatting**: Consistent code formatting enhances the code's readability and makes it easier to follow the logic.
